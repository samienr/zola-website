I'm studying <colorize>Electrical and Computer Engineering</colorize> at the <span style="color: #bf5700;">***UT Austin***</span> with a focus in <colorize>computer architecture</colorize> and <colorize>embedded systems.</colorize>

I enjoy [photography,](@/photography/index.md) [mechanical keyboards,](../tags/keyboards/) and maintaining my homelab.

When I have some free time, I like <colorize>bouldering</colorize> and <colorize>modding video game consoles.</colorize>

If you have any inquiries or would just like to say hello, feel free to [reach out!](../contact) I'd love to hear from you.
