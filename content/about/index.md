I'm currently working on my Bachelor's degree in <colorize class="hover">Electrical and Computer Engineering</colorize>.

I am currently interested in <colorize>computer architecture</colorize> and <colorize>embedded systems.</colorize>

I enjoy [photography](@/photography/index.md), designing+building ergonomic [keyboards](../tags/keyboards/), and maintaining my <colorize>homelab</colorize>. I also started looking into <colorize>reverse engineering</colorize> and <colorize>hardware hacking</colorize>, which I've been having a lot of fun with.

When I have a little free time, I like <colorize>rock climbing,</colorize> watching <colorize>films,</colorize> and making <colorize>digital art.</colorize>

When I have A LOT of free time, I often work on animations that explain mathematical or engineering concepts using Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) [manim](https://www.manim.community/) Python library and <colorize>Adobe After Effects.</colorize>

I started this website to share whatever I learn with the world. Hopefully it offers benefit to someone!

If you have any inquiries or would just like to say hello, feel free to [reach out!](../contact) I'd love to hear from you.

## Current Reading:
Recently, I've started reading more as opposed to doomscrolling on social media. Here are some books I'm working through:

- <colorize>*Practical Cryptography,*</colorize> by Bruce Schneier and Niels Ferguson
- <colorize>*Mistborn: The Final Empire,*</colorize> by Brandon Sanderson
