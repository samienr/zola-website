If $S=\\{\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2, \\dots, \\vec{v}_k \\}$ is a set of vectors, then the *<colorize>span</colorize>* of $S$, denoted by $\\text{span}\\{S\\}$. is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$.

$$
\\text{span}\\{\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}\\} = \\{ c\\vec{u}+d\\vec{v}\\; |\\; c,d \\in R \\}
$$
- Asking whether a vector is in the span of some other vectors is the same as asking if it is in the span of those other vectors.
