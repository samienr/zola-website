If $S=\\{\vec{v}\_{1}, \vec{v}\_{2}, \dots, \vec{v}\_{k}\\}$ is a set of vectors, then the *<colorize>span</colorize>* of $S$, denoted by $\\text{span}\\{S\\}$. is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$.
{% katex() %}
\text{span}\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}\} = \{ c\vec{u}+d\vec{v}\; |\; c,d \in R \}
{% end %}
- Asking whether a vector is in the span of some other vectors is the same as asking if it is in the span of those other vectors.
