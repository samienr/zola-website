As a college student, affordability and quick access are key, and the custom keyboard is just the opposite of that, so I decided to take on this project myself.\nI figured if I were going to design the keyboard entirely myself, I might as well make it as custom as possible. I was going to design this keyboard something just for myself.\nDesign\nWithin a few weeks of snooping around online, I discovered a whole world of bizarrely-shaped, split keyboards. I very quickly became inspired by the Lily58 and the Corne. I learned that the  motivation behind these strange layouts came from two goals that I had myself:\n\nReducing finger movement\nEnhanced typing comfort\n\nBoth of these goals are achieved by two design choices:\n\nLess keys = less places for my fingers to go\nKey placement matching the natural positioning of fingers— meaning a split layout\n\nTo start, I mapped out a rough layout by tracing my finger movements using a painting app on an iPad.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nSuper basic, I know.\nThat gave a basic idea of the where each finger naturally goes as I extend them.\nAs for hardware, I chose:\n\nSeeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 microcontroller for its Bluetooth Low Energy capability, affordable price, and ARM architecture.\nKalih Choc Red switches for their low profile and because I like linear switches\n\n\nErgogen\nI needed a tool to design the layout and found Ergogen. , which uses a simple YAML format to create layouts. Thanks to a helpful blog series by FlatFootFox, I defined a 3x6 grid for keys on each hand, matching the finger positions I had determined on the iPad. The flexibility of YAML allowed me to easily tweak the layout until it felt and looked right. Here's a snippet of my Ergogen config:\n\nI used Ceoloide's footprint for the switch footprints, which are reversible, meaning that both halves of the board can use the same PCB design.\n\n\t\n\t\n\nPreview of layout generated in Ergogen\n\nPCB Design\nErgogen generated a KiCad file with the board outline and switch footprints. I had to create and route the traces. Additionally, the footprint I used for the nRF52840 didn't account for its battery pads, so I had to modify the footprint by adding a small cutout to route battery wires through. I haven't messed around with PCBs before this besides some basic designs from school, so that was a nice learning experience. The supportive community on the Absolem Club Discord server helped me through the process.\n\n\t\n\t\n\nThe PCB Ergogen generated\n\n\t\n\t\n\nAfter adding traces and adjusting the microcontroller footprint\nOnce all the electronics were in place, I decided to add some decorative patterns to the pcb, as I decided not to use a plate on this keyboard.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nAnd with that, the PCB design was pretty much done. All that was left was ordering everything and putting it all together.\nAssembly and Firmware\nI ordered my PCB from JLCPCB in black and white for about 20 USD, the microcontroller from SeeedStudio, and the other components from Typeractive.\nI used my university's makerspace for soldering, learning about reflow soldering for smaller components.\nKeymap\nFirst, I defined the keymap. I opted for Colemak-DH, as it was designed to be a more ergonomic layout that also allows for faster typing speeds. The other layers were designed by seeing various designs online and then just iterating.\nI had initially set out to write the keymap directly to the ZMK keymap file, but I quickly found Keymap Editor, an online tool that can connect to a ZMK repository on GitHub and manage the keymaps with a very easy to use GUI. I used the tool to create these keymaps:\n\n\t\n\t\n\nDefault layer\n\n\t\n\t\n\nSymbol layer\n\n\t\n\t\n\nNumber layer\n\n\t\n\t\n\nFunction layer\n\n\t\n\t\n\nGaming layer\nI also decided to make another layer for gaming to keep the WASD layout, but I haven’t been able to test how effective this is.\nFirmware\nI then opted for the ZMK Firmware, namely because QMK does not support wireless boards due to some licensing issues with Bluetooth, and because I do intend on learning Zephyr eventually, which ZMK is based on.\nI began by mapping the pins on the microcontroller to the corresponding columns and rows of the keyboard matrix. I probably should’ve planned these before designing the PCB, but I chose these pins retroactively, as the PCB traces were already routed.\nPin NumberDigitalMatrix mapping\nP0.020Outer Column\nP0.031Pinky Column\nP0.282Middle Column + outerthumb\nP0.293Index Column + middlethumb\nP0.044Inner Column + innerthumb\nP1.127Upper Row\nP1.138Middle Row\nP1.149Lower Row\nP1.1510Thumb Row\n\nCreating the shield\nBecause this keyboard was completely original, there wasn’t a pre-existing shield, so I had to make my own. That wasn’t so bad. The ZMK documentation is very well written and easy to follow.\nAll that was left was to compile and flash the firmware! Not Really\nTrouble in Paradise\nDespite the careful planning and assembly, I ran into a significant issue: the left half of the keyboard worked perfectly and paired with my devices, but the right half was unresponsive.\nInitial Diagnosis\nI tried resetting the firmware, suspecting an issue with the pairing process. This fixed the issue in that the right half now connected, but it also led me to find another problem: most keys on the right half were unresponsive, and pressing the top key in each column caused all keys in that column to ghost.\nPhysical Troubleshooting\nI grabbed a multimeter to test each diode, as my soldering job for the right half was particularly ugly, but each diode was functioning correctly. Next, I tested each diode-switch pair, where I did find an inconsistency in voltages. I then tried flipping all the diodes, as perhaps the direction needed to be flipped because the board was flipped, but this yielded no change. It was time to take a look at the PCB.\nPCB Analysis\nI next decided to take a look at the PCB layout. This is where I found the culprit. I discovered that I had forgotten to route one of the pads on the backside (the front for the right side of the board). Fortunately, because the left and right halves of the board use the same PCB, I was able to simply resolder the microcontroller to the back side of the right half. I knew this would work because the left side worked flawlessly, and although the diode pads were on the other side, all the switch connections were through-holes, so the side on which they were installed would not matter. All that was left was to compensate with software by reversing the order of the pins. This finally worked.\nConclusion\nThis project was a bit challenging but very rewarding, providing me with a custom mechanical keyboard tailored to my preferences. It was also my first truly original electronics project, and it taught me a lot about PCB design and soldering, all through practical hands-on experience. This project also helped in refining my independent problem-solving skills, as I am used to having either documentation or peers to take help from. I hope this inspires others to try their hand at DIY keyboard building!\nOpen Source (?)\nI've finally open sourced the keyboard design files on this Github repository. I haven't yet fixed the PCB routing mistake, though I do plan on getting to it eventually. It's just not a high priority at the moment. Feel free to do whatever you want with the designs, this project was more for the learning experience.\nNext Steps\nI'm probably going to work on a case for the boards next. The goal as it stands now is to create a model for 3D printing just to protect the boards (and the surfaces I put them on), then to eventually design a case for either CNC milling or resin printing that holds the boards at the most comfortable angles for me.\n\n\t\n\t\n\nThe completed product\n","id":"https://samienr.com/blog/keyboard/","title":"How I Designed My First Custom Keyboard"},"https://samienr.com/blog/soundhax/":{"body":"\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tSoundHax was patched as of firmware version 11.4 and does not work on any Nintendo 3DS system running firmware 11.4 or higher.\n\n\nSoundHax was one of the most accessible exploits to get unsigned code running on the Nintendo 3DS. It worked by abusing a bug found in the Nintendo 3DS Sound application with a specially-crafted .m4a file.\nThe exploit was special as it was the first exploit on the 3DS that was free, offline, and worked on every version of the firmware as of when it was discovered.\nTo fully appreciate this brilliant symphony of hacks, a basic understanding of memory management is recommended. I wrote a quick and dirty explainer over here if you want a fast refresher.\nBefore proceeding, I'd also highly suggest reading the writeup on Nedwill's GitHub page\n\nThe Vulnerability\nFor context, the M4A format uses the MP4 file format. At its core, SoundHax exploits a bug in how the Nintendo 3DS Sound application handles MP4 atom tags.\nThat is, when loading in an M4A file, a 256-byte buffer is allocated on the heap for song names (the max size according to the MP4 spec).\nThe song name is then copied from the file into the buffer using one of two functions:\n\nFor ASCII strings, strncpy(dst, src, 256) is used, which is safe.\nFor Unicode strings, memcpy() is used, which takes a user-provided size instead of 256 (not safe!).\n\nUnicode strings likely didn't use strncpy() because it stops at the first null terminating byte (which is used for marking the end of an ASCII string). Unicode can have null bytes as parts of characters, which means that strncpy() wouldn't work well.\nInstead, song names are simply gathered by copying over as many bytes as the file specifies, even if the number is greater than 256.\nThis means that the program code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\nBy providing a carefully crafted Unicode title longer than 256 bytes, an attacker can write data beyond the allocated buffer and into other parts of console memory.\nThe Exploit\nTaking advantage of this bug, we can get arbitrary code execution on the 3DS using the following steps:\n\nCreating an M4A file with an oversized Unicode title\nCausing a Buffer Overflow in the Heap\nCorrupting the Heap Metadata\nUnlink Exploitation\nHeap Feng Shui\nConstructing and Executing a ROP Chain\nAbusing the GPU ('gspwn')\nUnlimited Power!!!\n\nAnyways, here's how it works.\n1. Crafting the malicious File\nThe exploit begins with the construction of a M4A file containing a specially crafted Unicode title that's intentionally oversized. Nedwill used a Python script to do this:\n\nThis creates a 772 byte string for the title. But this alone isn't enough.\nThe MP4 file format needs each piece of data to be labeled with its exact size which means we also need the file metadata to tell the 3DS how long this title is. When the rest of this Python script builds the final M4A file, it calculates the length of our oversized title and embeds it as binary data into the file header, like any other MP4 file is structured.\nThe file isn't lying about anything, it genuinely contains 772 bytes of title data, properly labeled and all. It's just that 772 bytes is way too many bytes for a title, and it goes well over the allocated space of 256 bytes. This means that the rest of the 516 bytes end up writing over other regions of memory.\n2. Triggering the Heap Overflow\nWhen the Nintendo 3DS Sound application encounters our special file, it will read the size field in the file metadata, sees \"772 bytes of title data,\" and trustingly pass this value to the memcpy() function without questioning whether 772 bytes is a reasonable length for a song title.\nWhen this happens, the 3DS:\n\nallocates the standard 256-byte buffer.\nuses memcpy with our provided length.\ncopies our oversized title, writing beyond the buffer's boundaries\n\n3. Heap Manipulation and Unlink Exploitation\nHeap Manipulation\nThe heap overflow allows us to manipulate the heap's metadata structures. Modern heap implementations maintain information about memory chunks, including:\n\nChunk sizes\nUsage status\nForward/backward pointers\nBoundary tags\n\nBy overflowing into these structures, we can override some of this metadata and fool the heap manager into operating using this fake data. If you're a little confused, take a look at this\nUnlink Exploitation\nWhen the heap manager needs to free a chunk, it performs an \"unlink\" operation to remove the chunk from its internal data structures and possibly also merge it with adjacent free chunks.\nPart of this operation involves updating the forward and backward pointers of a chunk. This process assumes that the chunk metadata is trustworthy. Our fake chunk exploits this trust to achieve arbitrary memory writes.\nThis typically looks something like this:\n\nThe allocator pretty much goes \"if this chunk says its next chunk is at address X, then I'll update the chunk at address X to point back to the previous chunk.\" Except we are in control of those addresses. That is to say, we choose what address X is, and we control what the previous chunk's address is, so we can make the allocator write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, A.K.A. an arbitrary write primitive.\n4. Stack Manipulation | \"Heap Feng Shui\"\nWith control over the unlink operation, we can write to any memory location. However, this power must be wielded strategically. The SoundHax exploit uses a technique known as heap feng shui to gain control over the program's execution stack.\nThe goal is to trick the heap allocator into returning a stack address when the program next requests a memory allocation. As for what this stack address is, Nedwill had to painstakingly find a particular address that's contents look like a valid heap chunk with seemingly proper heap chunk metadata values\nWe use our arbitrary write primitive to overwrite the heap's free list header with this stack address (via the unlick exploitation). At the same time, we manipulate the size field of the chunk being freed to make it appear very small, preventing it from being a viable option the next time the allocator looks for a free chunk. This sets up our fake stack \"chunk\" as the primary candidate for the next allocation.\nWhen the program makes its next malloc() call, the heap allocator searches through the free list looking for a suitable block. It finds our fake chunk on the stack, validates that it has enough space and proper metadata, and then returns the stack address as if it were heap memory.\n5. ROP Chain Construction and Execution\nWith step 4, the application writes data to what it thinks is allocated heap memory, but it's actually writing to the program's execution stack. Since the stack contains values such return addresses and the local variables of functions, we now have access to control the program's execution flow.\nUnfortunately for us, however, we can't go ahead and just write in instructions (A.K.A. shellcode) just yet. Modern systems, such as the one on the 3DS, have some protections to prevent executing code on the stack or heap. However, we can work around this by using a technique known as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), which chains together small pieces of existing code to perform our desired operations.\nThink of ROP as something like the cut-up technique, where an artist cuts scraps out of a book or magazine, then rearranges these scraps to create a new text the author never intended.\n\n\t\n\t\n\tImagine each one of these scraps is a piece of code.\n\t\n\n\nEach piece of code, or \"gadget,\" in our ROP chain is a small fragment of actual program code that performs a simple operation, like loading a register or calling a function, then returns control to the next gadget in the sequence.\nThe SoundHax ROP chain performs a handful of operations. First, it copies our second-stage payload from the stack to heap memory. Next, it sets up parameters for some GPU operations. Then it actually calls these GPU functions to perform memory copying operations that would normally be forbidden (more on this in the next section). Finally, it transfers control to our newly-positioned code.\nEach step of this process uses code that already exists in the application's memory space, making it extremely difficult for most prevention mechanisms to detect our attack.\n6. GPU-Assisted Code Injection (gspwn)\nI briefly mentioned GPU functions. Now let's actually talk about why we're using graphics calls and how genius this move is.\nWhen gaining code execution through the ROP chain, we were still constrained by the system's memory protection mechanisms, meaning that we weren't yet able to overwrite any of the application's code segment from userland. This usually isn't allowed as that would violate a bunch of security boundaries-- user applications should be kept separate from system code.\nNedwill's solution to get around this was pretty creative: Abusing the 3DS's GPU. The GPU has special privileges to perform direct memory access (DMA) transfers between memory regions. This means that while almost nothing should be able to copy data from heap memory into the executable text segment of running applications, the GPU can.\nThis technique, known as 'gspwn' in the 3DS homebrew community, effectively bypasses the system's code signing and memory protection by using the GPU as an unwitting accomplice in our attack. The GPU doesn't know or care that we're abusing its power, it simply performs whatever operation is requested.\n7. Full Code Execution\nWith our payload now residing in executable memory, the final step is to transfer control to it. Our ROP chain concludes by jumping to the newly-written code, which implements a second-stage loader that performs the final steps of the compromise.\nThe stage-2 payload disables potentially problematic system threads that might interfere with homebrew execution. It then opens and reads the otherapp.bin file from the SD card, which contains the homebrew launcher. For the uninitiated, the homebrew launcher is the gateway to running homebrew applications (a.k.a. unsigned code that can be written by anyone without Nintendo's approval). The ROP chain uses the GPU one more time to copy this payload into memory and transfer control to it.\nAt this point, the system is fully compromised and running arbitrary unsigned code with the same privileges as the original Sound application. The user will now see the homebrew launcher appear on screen.\nConclusion\nUnlike many other exploits for various game consoles, SoundHax required no internet connection, specific games, hardware modifications, or any complex setup procedures. Users could simply download the appropriate M4A file for their region and firmware version, copy it to their SD card, and play it through that built-in Nintendo 3DS Sound application.\n","id":"https://samienr.com/blog/soundhax/","title":"How The Nintendo 3DS Was Hacked Using a Music File"},"https://samienr.com/contact/":{"body":"Feel free to send me a message on either of these.
